This project was conducted for the IN4253ET "Hacking Lab" course at the Delft University of Technology.  
The goal of the project was to find out how much amplification can be achieved by using the DNS infrastructure of the Dutch Government.

The [repository](https://github.com/gregor160300/IN4253ET-HackingLab) contains both the scripts used to generate the results used in the [paper](https://github.com/gregor160300/IN4253ET-HackingLab/blob/main/results/paper.pdf)
but also a proof of concept attack implemented in Go.
