I have always been interested in optimizing my setup and workflow, be it my EDC (Every Day Carry), desk setup or ricing my linux environment.
Looking at what other people are using has been instrumental in improving my own configuration, so I decided to dedicate this page to
sharing my own setup, in case anyone is interested.

PC and [laptop](https://frame.work/) both running Arch linux ([dotfiles](https://github.com/WJehee/.dotfiles))  
I use a Google pixel 4a running [Calyx OS](https://calyxos.org/).

### Applications I use

- [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/) and [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) for email
- [Simplelogin](https://simplelogin.io/) for email aliasing
- [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) for navigation
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note taking
- [DavX5](https://www.davx5.com/) for calendar and tasks synchronisation
- [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) for password management
- [Aegis](https://getaegis.app/) for 2 Factor Authentication
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for file synchronization between devices
